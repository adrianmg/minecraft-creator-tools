/**
 * ARCHITECTURE DOCUMENTATION: DedicatedServer - Minecraft Server Process Manager
 * ===============================================================================
 *
 * DedicatedServer manages a single instance of Minecraft Bedrock Dedicated Server,
 * handling process lifecycle, command execution, content deployment, and world backups.
 *
 * ## Core Responsibilities
 *
 * 1. **Process Lifecycle**: Start, stop, and monitor bedrock_server.exe
 * 2. **Command Execution**: Send commands to the server via stdin
 * 3. **Output Parsing**: Parse server stdout for events (player join/leave, test results)
 * 4. **Content Deployment**: Deploy add-on packs to the running server
 * 5. **World Backup**: Backup world files during runtime using save hold/resume
 * 6. **Debug Client**: Connect to the Minecraft script debugger for profiling
 *
 * ## Server Folder Structure
 *
 * Each DedicatedServer instance operates in a runtime server folder:
 *
 * ```
 * srv20260101120000/                      (Runtime server folder)
 *   ├─ bedrock_server.exe                 (Copied from source)
 *   ├─ server.properties                  (Generated, configures ports, world name)
 *   ├─ allowlist.json                     (Symlink to source)
 *   ├─ permissions.json                   (Symlink to source)
 *   ├─ config/                            (Generated config folder)
 *   │   ├─ default.json                   (Creator Tools server config)
 *   │   └─ ...
 *   ├─ behavior_packs/                    (Junction to source vanilla packs)
 *   ├─ resource_packs/                    (Junction to source vanilla packs)
 *   ├─ definitions/                       (Junction to source definitions)
 *   ├─ development_behavior_packs/        (Writable - deployed add-ons go here)
 *   │   └─ my_addon_abc123_my_bp/         (Symlink to pack cache folder)
 *   ├─ development_resource_packs/        (Writable - deployed add-ons go here)
 *   │   └─ my_addon_abc123_my_rp/         (Symlink to pack cache folder)
 *   └─ worlds/
 *       └─ defaultWorld/                  (Writable - active world data)
 *           ├─ level.dat                  (World metadata in NBT format)
 *           ├─ levelname.txt              (World display name)
 *           ├─ world_behavior_packs.json  (Active behavior packs for world)
 *           ├─ world_resource_packs.json  (Active resource packs for world)
 *           └─ db/                        (LevelDB world data)
 *               ├─ CURRENT
 *               ├─ MANIFEST-000001
 *               ├─ *.ldb                  (Immutable SSTable files)
 *               └─ *.log                  (Write-ahead log)
 * ```
 *
 * ## Startup Sequence
 *
 * 1. **Signature Verification**: On Windows, verify bedrock_server.exe is Microsoft-signed
 * 2. **Folder Setup**: Create development_*_packs and worlds/defaultWorld if needed
 * 3. **Config Generation**: Write server.properties with port, world name, settings
 * 4. **World Restoration**: Optionally restore from latest backup
 * 5. **Process Spawn**: Launch server with stdin/stdout capture
 *    - Windows: spawn bedrock_server.exe directly
 *    - Linux: spawn bedrock_server with LD_LIBRARY_PATH set
 * 6. **Ready Detection**: Parse stdout for "Server started" message
 * 7. **Debugger Connection**: Connect to script debugger on port 19144
 * 8. **Position Polling**: Start polling for player positions
 *
 * ## Linux Compatibility
 *
 * The server supports both Windows and Linux with these platform-specific behaviors:
 *
 * - **Executable**: `bedrock_server.exe` on Windows, `bedrock_server` on Linux
 * - **Library Path**: On Linux, `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` is set to the server directory
 * - **Signature Check**: Authenticode verification is Windows-only (skipped on Linux)
 * - **Path Handling**: Uses platform-aware path delimiters throughout
 *
 * ## Restart Backoff Strategy
 *
 * If the server crashes unexpectedly, it will attempt to restart with exponential
 * backoff to avoid resource exhaustion:
 *
 * | Crash # | Delay Before Restart |
 * |---------|---------------------|
 * | 1       | 1 second            |
 * | 2       | 2 seconds           |
 * | 3       | 4 seconds           |
 * | 4+      | Stop auto-restart   |
 *
 * The crash counter resets after 60 seconds of stable operation.
 *
 * ## World Backup Strategy
 *
 * Backups are performed using the Bedrock server's safe backup protocol:
 *
 * ```
 * Normal Operation                     Backup Sequence
 *       │                                    │
 *       │  ┌───── save hold ─────────────►  │ (1) Suspend world writes
 *       │  │                                 │
 *       │  │      save query ─────────────► │ (2) Get list of modified files
 *       │  │                                 │
 *       │  │  ◄──── file list ────────────  │ (3) Server returns file paths & sizes
 *       │  │                                 │
 *       │  │      [copy files] ───────────► │ (4) Copy only modified files
 *       │  │                                 │
 *       │  │      save resume ────────────► │ (5) Resume world writes
 *       │  │                                 │
 *       │  └─────────────────────────────►  │
 * ```
 *
 * Backup folders are stored in a configurable location (default: user's Documents):
 * ```
 * Documents/mctools/worlds/
 *   └─ world/
 *       ├─ world20260101120000/          (Timestamped backup)
 *       │   ├─ files.json                (File listing with sizes)
 *       │   ├─ level.dat
 *       │   └─ db/
 *       │       └─ <only modified .ldb files>
 *       └─ world20260101130000/          (Later backup)
 * ```
 *
 * **Incremental Backup Optimization**:
 * - The backup system tracks SHA hashes of LevelDB files
 * - Only files that have changed since the last backup are copied
 * - This is especially efficient for LevelDB's immutable SSTable (.ldb) files
 * - The `backupWorldFileListings` in ServerManager tracks known files across backups
 *
 * **Backup Timeout Protection**:
 * - A 60-second timeout prevents backup from getting stuck if server doesn't respond
 * - If timeout fires, save is forcefully resumed and an error is logged
 * - Timeout is cleared when backup completes successfully or server stops
 *
 * ## Content Deployment Strategy (Feb 2026)
 *
 * Hot-reload is ENABLED for **script-only changes** on subsequent deploys.
 * The first deploy always restarts to register packs with the world.
 *
 * Decision logic (in `deploy()` method):
 *
 * 1. **First deploy** (`deployCount === 0`): Always restart — packs must be registered
 * 2. **Subsequent deploys** with server running:
 *    a. Capture before/after thumbprints of behavior + resource packs
 *    b. If resource pack files changed → restart (textures/models can't hot-reload)
 *    c. If behavior pack changes are script-only (.js/.ts/.map, no deletions) → `/reload`
 *    d. Otherwise → restart
 * 3. **Caller override**: `isReloadable=false` forces restart regardless
 *
 * The `MinecraftUtilities.isReloadableSetOfChanges()` function gates the decision:
 * it returns true only when ALL file diffs are `.js`, `.ts`, or `.map` with no deletions.
 *
 * When deploying add-on content:
 *
 * **Hot-Reload Path** (script-only changes, subsequent deploys):
 * 1. **Sync Files**: Copy new/modified files to development_*_packs folders
 * 2. **Thumbprint Diff**: Compare before/after to determine what changed
 * 3. **Run `/reload`**: Hot-reload scripts without server restart
 *
 * **Restart Path** (structural changes, first deploy, or caller override):
 * 1. **Sync Files**: Copy new/modified files to development_*_packs folders
 * 2. **Update Pack References**: Ensure world_behavior_packs.json has pack UUIDs
 * 3. **Stop Server**: Graceful shutdown with backup
 * 4. **Restart Server**: Fresh start picks up all changes
 *
 * ## Slot Sentinel File (ServerManager)
 *
 * Each slot folder contains a sentinel file (`slot_context.json`) that records:
 * - Source server version and path
 * - When the slot was provisioned
 * - Deployed pack UUIDs and versions
 * - World settings and experiments enabled
 *
 * On startup, ServerManager compares the current context against the sentinel:
 * - If context matches: Reuse existing slot (fast startup)
 * - If context differs: Backup world, rebuild slot, restore world, re-deploy
 *
 * ## Server Output Parsing
 *
 * The server's stdout is continuously parsed for significant events:
 *
 * | Log Message Pattern         | Action                                    |
 * |-----------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
 * | "Server started"            | Mark as running, enable debug, poll positions |
 * | "Player connected"          | Extract player name/xuid, emit event     |
 * | "Player disconnected"       | Extract player name/xuid, emit event     |
 * | "Data saved"                | Backup sequence state machine trigger    |
 * | "Changes to the level are resumed" | Backup complete notification      |
 * | "Loaded test: ..."          | GameTest started event                   |
 * | "passed test: ..."          | GameTest passed event                    |
 * | "failed test: ..."          | GameTest failed event                    |
 *
 * **Process identity invariant** (bug fixed Aug 2026 - keep this!): a restart
 * can launch a replacement process while the old process is still stopping
 * (stopServer() writes "stop" and returns without waiting for exit), so the
 * old stdout stream may still be draining buffered lines and the old process
 * has a close event yet to deliver. Every state mutation is therefore gated
 * on identity: directOutput() ignores state-mutating lines whose stream id
 * has been superseded (a delayed "Server started" from the old process must
 * not re-run debugger setup; a delayed "Quit correctly" must not
 * continueStopServer() the replacement's process handle away), and the close
 * handler registered by attachProcess() is bound to its specific
 * ChildProcess and no-ops unless that process is still #activeProcess.
 * Superseded output is still recorded/forwarded for display.
 *
 * ## Script Debugger Integration
 *
 * The debugger flow follows an explicit lifecycle model (DebuggerLifecycle.ts):
 * configuring -> startingListener -> waitingForReadiness -> connectingTcp ->
 * negotiating -> selectingTarget -> resuming -> connected, with reconnecting /
 * stopping / failed side states. Stage changes are dispatched via
 * onDebugStageChanged so the Electron/web UX can show precise progress and
 * stage-specific recovery actions.
 *
 * 1. On "Server started": verify server.properties debugger settings
 *    (allow-inbound-script-debugging), then wait DEBUG_LISTEN_DELAY_MS
 * 2. Reserve a collision-free dynamic debug port (DebugPortRegistry;
 *    preferred: base port + 12, e.g., 19144 for slot 0)
 * 3. Send `script debugger listen <port>` and wait for the parsed
 *    "Debugger listening" confirmation. If BDS never confirms (or prints
 *    "Failed to start debugger"), the flow FAILS with a specific error kind -
 *    there is deliberately no success-shaped fallback timeout
 * 4. Connect MinecraftDebugClient to localhost:<port> (if
 *    enableDebuggerStreaming=true); the client handles handshake, passcode,
 *    target module selection, and resume
 * 5. Forward debug events to ServerManager → HttpServer/IPC → clients
 *
 * **Configuration**:
 * - `enableDebugger` (default: true): Whether BDS enables script debugger listening
 * - `enableDebuggerStreaming` (default: true for serve command): Whether we connect and stream debug stats
 *
 * **Cleanup and reconnect invariants** (bugs fixed Aug 2026 - keep these!):
 * - All debugger timers are tracked in fields and cleared in
 *   resetDebuggerRuntimeState(); anonymous fire-and-forget timers previously
 *   leaked across stop/restart and poked dead server runs
 * - #debugClient is cleared on EVERY disconnect path (previously a dropped
 *   connection left a stale reference that blocked reconnection forever)
 * - Dropped connections reconnect with exponential backoff (max 5 attempts);
 *   passcode/protocol-mismatch failures fail fast instead of retrying
 * - stopServer() marks the lifecycle "stopping" BEFORE writing "stop" so the
 *   imminent socket close is not misclassified as a failure
 * - A handshake that completes with NO script module to select does not reset
 *   the reconnect budget: BDS closes module-less sessions right after the
 *   handshake, and resetting on that short-lived "connected" produced an
 *   endless connect/drop churn. The drop is classified moduleSelection (not
 *   prematureClose) so the user sees the actionable cause (add a behavior
 *   pack with a script module)
 * - Session info exposed via HTTP API: /api/{slot}/status includes debugConnectionState
 * - Reattach vs. in-flight attach race: a user-driven reattach can discard an
 *   automatic attach whose dial is still retrying. disconnect() cancels that
 *   dial (MinecraftDebugClient aborts its retry loop and destroys the pending
 *   socket), and every subscriber/post-await in connectDebugClient() is
 *   guarded by `#debugClient === client` identity so a superseded client can
 *   never mutate or clear its replacement's state, occupy BDS's single
 *   debugger slot, or cause a false external-owner classification.
